Introduction:
Nevertheless, you decide to take up the challenge and prepare your action plan to meet the demand of the Mr.Coffee company:

 

First, you will build a very basic web application, without a database or even real web pages. You will simply make an application that accepts requests from a client, and returns information. (Project 3A)

Then you will return the information as actual web pages. So you're going to start again from project 3A, and instead of returning the information directly, you're going to put this information into HTML code using templates. Your application then becomes a real web application! (Project 3B)

Finally, you will integrate a database into your project so that the information returned by your application can be persistent. (Project 3C)
 

This action plan will allow you to provide, in 3 steps, a prototype to the Mr.Coffee company.
